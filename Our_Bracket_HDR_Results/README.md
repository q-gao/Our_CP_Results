# Our Bracket HDR results 
-	Our algorithm can handle moving objects (leaves, people, cars, doors and etc.) well in most cases
-	It also handle bright areas with fine details well, e.g., windows blinds with bright outside
- Note that the results were generated by only aligning and fusing multiple photos of different exposures without going through a full ISP pipeline. As such, its white balance, contrast, sharpness and etc. are not optimum. Please focus on their tone.
